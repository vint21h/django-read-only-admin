# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

So, because this is not a thing that can produce security problems in the project using it,
security policy is very simple: supported only the last major or minor branch.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| 0.16.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found something that in your opinion may produce any security problem, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/vint21h/django-read-only-admin/issues/new/).
